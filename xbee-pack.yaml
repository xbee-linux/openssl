schema-version: 1.0

description: |
  The OpenSSL package contains management tools and libraries relating to cryptography. 
  These are useful for providing cryptographic functions to other packages, such as OpenSSH, email applications, and web browsers (for accessing HTTPS sites).

  Installed programs: c_rehash and openssl
  Installed libraries: libcrypto.so and libssl.so
  Installed directories: /etc/ssl, /usr/include/openssl, /usr/lib/engines and /usr/share/doc/openssl-1.1.1l

  Short Descriptions
    c_rehash: is a Perl script that scans all files in a directory and adds symbolic links to their hash values
    openssl: is a command-line tool for using the various cryptography functions of OpenSSL's crypto library from the shell. It can be used for various functions which are documented in man 1 openssl

    libcrypto.so: implements a wide range of cryptographic algorithms used in various Internet standards. The services provided by this library are used by the OpenSSL implementations of SSL, TLS and S/MIME, and they have also been used to implement OpenSSH, OpenPGP, and other cryptographic standards
    libssl.so: implements the Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocol. It provides a rich API, documentation on which can be found by running man 3 ssl
